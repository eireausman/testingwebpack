Objective of project: 
Understand how Webpack works.  

Product:
Made a small restaurant set of pages using Webpack modules.  The look and feel is very basic, but that's deliberate when meeting the objective (understanding Webpack). 

Learning Outcome:
I learned how Webpack functions.  It's a very powerful and useful tool.  From reading the docs, there is a lot of functionality I have yet to use, but the basics (build process, modules, transpiling, dev server setup) have already proven to be very useful.

I'll be trying to use Webpack but for future projects where appropriate, as I have really enjoyed using it.
